# Car Game (Command Line)

A simple text-based car simulation game written in Python. The user can enter commands like `start`, `stop`, `help`, or `quit` to interact with the car.

## How it works

- Type `start` to start the car.
- Type `stop` to stop the car.
- Type `help` to see a list of valid commands.
- Type `quit` to exit the game.

The program keeps track of the car's state (started or stopped) and responds appropriately if the user tries to start it again while it's already running, or stop it when itâ€™s already stopped.
